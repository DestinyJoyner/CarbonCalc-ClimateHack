Explore [CarbonCalc](https://climate-hackathon.netlify.app/) for yourself! 


## Inspiration
We were inspired by the lack of self-awareness when it comes to individual impact on the planet due to carbon emissions.

## What it does
**CarbonCalc** is a Mobile-First App that takes in user selections/inputs and calculates an estimated Monthly Carbon Footprint amount. The results page gives the user's annual Carbon Footprint and compares it to various countries and ranges ( low emissions / average / high emissions ) per person.

## How we built it
We built **CarbonCalc** using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and React
Packages: React-Icons, React-Router, ContextProvider [custom React Hook]
ChatGPT: Generated an object of data to calculate Carbon Emissions from various sources

## Challenges we ran into
- Comparing different measuring systems for Carbon Emissions (Lbs, Tons, etc...) 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Building a functional App in a weekend
- Solid GitHub workflow
- Coordinating in a team of 5 devs
- Mutual communication and learning

## What we learned
- Carbon Footprint numbers and their meaning
- How to decrease Carbon Emissions with minor habit changes

## What's next for CarbonCalc
- Adding a Back-End App to store data, user accounts, user interactivity
- Creating an API
